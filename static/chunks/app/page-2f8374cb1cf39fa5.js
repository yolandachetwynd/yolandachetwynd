The goddess of love’s name resonates from the forming of myths into the present day—even finding a place in teenagers’ imaginations. Why? This series of ten oil paintings explores that fascinating question.","My tale starts with the goddesss origin in the mists of time. Then we experience the creation and later rediscovery of her most influential manifestation, the “disarmed” Greek statue, the Venus de Milo. The final painting brings her into the modern day.","The initial, and most essential, inspiration for these paintings came from my daughter. As her “Odyssey of the Mind” project at Newark High School (DE), she and her teammates created a performance focusing on the Venus de Milo. Caroline submitted to being life-cast to re-create the sculpture. As my daughter researched the topic, I became increasingly drawn to the history/herstory of this icon. Then I discovered the book 'Disarmed: A Story of the Venus de Milo' by Gregory Curtis. And I began to think about recreating this story through my own artistic perspective.","My approach links a number of my influences and interests. My first thought was to create a graphic novel – comic books intrigue me as a storytelling medium. Later I decided to tell the story through a series of tableaus, the way Hogarth did in his Rake's Progress. Eight of the pieces are inspired by Rembrandt drawings, which influenced the paintings in terms of composition and structure. Two are based on woodcuts that illustrated the 1939 book on the rediscovery of the statue, 'La Venus de Milo et Olivier Voutier' by Jean-Paul Alaux.","On my palette (a large sheet of glass) I create “pools” of color, and often spend hours just mixing them to find the right “warm” green or flesh tone —the one that supports the story I have in mind and enhances the drama. Using this range of shades, I draw with the paint, moving tiny amounts of pigment around the surface of the canvas. As I work, iconography, symbols, and natural features appear, dissolve and reappear, often viewed from different perspectives. They provide clues and emphasis, and link the segments of the story together, even if the viewer does not consciously “recognize” them. I also focused on the way the paintings are staged and the way the figures stand, with their well-defined legs and feet. This gives them a feeling of permanence and presence, and keeps them grounded in their surroundings. As I worked on this series, I was surprised by how far removed the paintings have become from the drawings and woodcuts that inspired them. The story itself forced me to change the paintings! By retelling the stories of the past, we can see how they affect the present.","My paintings are a way to connect with our tribal history in a visual form, to explore the value of beauty, to answer the question of why an ageless myth and a statue nearly 2,000 years old remain a definition of beauty for us"]},Migration:{collectionDescription:[]},"L'arche":{collectionDescription:["Paintings done of L'arche community members in London."]},"Indian Monoprints":{collectionDescription:["Monopritns  from time spent in India"]}},l={Invasions:{bookletPDFName:"final_invasion_with_links.pdf",collectionDescription:["Yolanda Chetwynd has written a graphic novel, which takes about ten minutes to read.

In 2017 she won the Masters fellowship in Delaware for her visual art. This is the highest honor bestowed on Delawarean artists. She has consistently exhibited her art work since 1982. Her latest solo exhibition was in the City of Nantes in France. In addition to being recognized as a distinguished artist, Yolanda has been working for DIAE for the last 28 years. She has the institutional history of the pedagogy of aesthetic education. She was selected as one of eight regional teaching artists from National Association of Aesthetic Education Institutes AIAE, associated with Lincoln Center Institute for Arts in Education, in NYC, to implement a series of national training workshops. Her role was to mentor fellow teaching artists in developing advanced understanding of the specific philosophy and educational processes developed over years of Aesthetic Education practice, which was shared among member sites of the AIAE. This work was supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and others and produced a series of seven workshops, from May 2004 to August 2006. She was selected as a resource artist-in-residence by the Delaware Division of the Arts and she has worked with the Department of Education to help develop arts integrated units that combine arts study with core academic curriculum. In 2002, Yolanda was invited as a teaching art fellow for the Robert Rauschenberg workshop “The Power of Art 2002,” which was held at the National Gallery, and at the lab school, in Washington DC.","She was on the Board of Directors of Delcaps the Odyssey of the mind Delaware chapter. Her two adult children went through the Delaware public school system, so she understands the needs of parents and the importance of reaching children at all levels of ability. Before settling in Newark, Delaware she worked with and lived in L’Arche communities which provide homes and workplaces where people with and without intellectual disabilities live and work together as peers in London, England and Kolkata, India. In 1989, she earned a Masters in Professional Studies in Art Therapy at the Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, NY. Over the past 26 years Yolanda as a teaching artist Yolanda has collaborated with pre-school and K-12 class room teachers on over 100 projects and worked in the classroom with students of all ages.
